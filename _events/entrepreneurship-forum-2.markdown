The second forum of entrepreneurship will be entitled "Catalyzing Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurship toward Economic Diversity” to connect the public sector (ministries and agencies), local and international universities with the private sector (companies, organizations and factories), and the ﬁnancial sector (banks and venture capital funds) with each other. This annual platform will bring together stakeholders from all sectors to cooperate and present their experiences, challenges and success stories at the local and international levels. The forum will include: keynote speeches, panel discussions, workshops and an exhibition that will target all type of community who are interested in developing the ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship.
